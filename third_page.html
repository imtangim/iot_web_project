                <h2>Why protection is Important?</h2>
                <p class="p1">Lightning protection is important in Our Country because the country experiences a high incidence of lightning strikes due to its geographical location and climatic conditions.</p>
                <p>According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, lightning strikes kill around 200 people every year in Bangladesh, making it one of the most lightning-prone countries in the world. The country also experiences significant damage to infrastructure, such as buildings, power lines, and communication systems, due to lightning strikes.</p>

                <h2>What is the Solution?</h2>
                <p class="p1">Installing lightning protection systems in buildings and other structures is critical to reducing the risk of injury or death from lightning strikes and to protect infrastructure from damage. Lightning protection systems typically consist of conductors, rods, and grounding systems that channel the electrical charge of a lightning strike safely into the ground, away from the structure and its occupants</p>
                <p>Lightning protection is essential in Bangladesh to safeguard human life, protect infrastructure, and ensure safety during thunderstorms and lightning strikes</p>

                    <h2>Which is the Best Solution?</h2>
                    <p>ESE (Early Streamer Emission) based lightning protection is to provide an efficient and reliable way of protecting structures from direct lightning strikes.</p>
                    <p>ESE lightning protection systems use a device that emits an ionization field around the protected structure, which helps to attract the lightning strike to a predetermined point where it can be safely discharged into the ground.</p>

                    <h2>Why should use ESE type LPS?</h2>
                    <p class="p1">ESE lightning protection is commonly used in high-risk lightning areas, such as tropical regions or areas with a reliable way to protect structures from the destructive effects of lightning strikes.</p> <br>
                    <p>ESE-based lightning protection systems offer enhanced protection compared to traditional lightning protection systems because they can intercept lightning strikes from a longer distance and are effective in protecting large structures. They are also relatively easy to install and require less maintenance compared to traditional lightning protection systems, reducing the overall cost of ownership</p>
